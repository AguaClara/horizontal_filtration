### Semester Goals
Our goals for the semester are to begin design and fabrication of a horizontal flow filter. This will involve characterization of key parameters, using Fusion360 to make a model of the system, and fabrication of a prototype. As of the end of February, we have completed initial calculations and are beginning the model (using what Ethan have Rose have created as templates) in Fusion360. Over the next few days we hope to begin fabricating the prototype!
