#### **Abstract**

The goal of Horizontal Filtration is to develop a horizontal filtration system that is more compact and easier to build than AguaClara’s current, Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand Filter model. Last semester’s team [**say "the Spring 2018 team"; using the exact semester gives future readers a better sense of the timeline**] developed a design that utilized the relationship between backwash and operational speed and angled plate settlers. Our goals this semester are to test the plate settler concept in filtration and backwash conditions, and then fabricate the design. In the coming weeks, our primary objective is to test whether the plate design is sufficient to keep sand inside the filter.

#### **Introduction**

The horizontal filtration system stems from the OrigamiWaterLab proposed by AguaClara engineer Ethan Keller. [**You can link the repository if you think that could be useful to an industrious reader**] The idea is to fabricate a plant that is able to transition from flat into a 3D plant, much like origami. Currently, the EStaRS filter is unwieldy to ship because of its vertical design. The team of Spring 2018 then proposed a horizontal filtration design that uses horizontal flow for filtration and vertical flow for backwash. This design greatly decreases the amount of space that is occupied by the filter and the various parts that detach and attach cleanly makes transportation of the system far easier. The current design, consisting of an entrance and exit plate with a filter insert in between is shown in Figure 1. The goal this semester is to continue fabrication of the horizontal filtration model, to test the model to ensure that it functions as designed and make any necessary changes to the design.

#### **Previous Work**

The [**Fall 2018**] team started the semester by reading through reviewing the manual from last year’s team. During the Spring 2018 semester, the team designed a horizontal filtration system in which the ratio of the horizontal flow area and vertical area is designed such that backwash will fluidize the bed. The apparatus consists of a series of slits and a filter shelf insert. The slits allowed for water to flow from the inlet to the outlet. Between [**between what?**] was a filter insert that consists of a center plate and filter shelves. The filter shelves served as a place for the sand to settle instead of being carried out with the effluent. The siphon is then able to begin backwash by creating low pressure in the sand bed. Backwash gates are closed except for the bottom ones [**Bottom whats? Use very specific language**], requiring a higher velocity of water that rinses away any smaller particles from the sand. A crucial part of the design also lies in the carved channels of the center plate design. These channels allow for the free flow of water along the entrance and exit, as shown in Figure 2 below.

The [**Fall 2018**] team will continue tests done in the previous year to determine the feasibility and optimal geometry for the filter slats. Last semester, the team performed an experiment [**incomplete sentence?**]

Based on what was done in the previous year, the team will now create a jig from which the filter shelves and center plates can be constructed. Additionally, EPDM foam gaskets will be added to allow for tests of the forward filtration mode. Once successfully tested, components for backwash will be made - primarily the siphon system and filter gates, which may be the largest challenge due to there not being an adequate seal. Furthermore, construction such that the siphon valve is connected to the backwash gates could allow for easier operation.



#### **Experimentation**

Before we [**avoid using first person pronuns**]fabricate the filter, the team plans to fabricate a few apparatuses to test certain components of the filter system. The first is to continue last semester’s experiment of testing the filter shelves.

[**If you have pictures of the first and second set-ups include them to make the systems easier to understand**]

*Filter Shelf Experiment 1:*
1. A 1” pipe will be used for the inlet and a ¾ “ pipe for the outlet. A ¾’’ hole is drilled into 1” pipe about halfway up the pipe. The ¾ “ pipe cut on one end at an angle of 55 degrees.
2. Dry sand will be added until  about 4’’ above opening to outlet. The amount of sand that travels into outlet is measured.
3. Apparatus filled with water. Inlet and outlet are connected to the necessary pumps. The amount of sand that travels into outlet is measured.
4. The pumps are set to certain a speed (which will later be determined). The amount of sand that travels into outlet is measured.

[**the second half of steps 3 and 4 is the same. Is this intentional?**]

*Filter Shelf Experiment 2: Change Geometry*
1. The apparatus from Filter Shelf Experiment 1 will be used. A flat shelf with the a width of 1’’ is used.
2. The flat shelf is then inserted into the 1’’ pipe horizontally.
3. The flat shelf will be glued or secured in another way at either end to ensure that it does not rotate or move as water is pumped through. [**If this fab technique is elaborated on below, mention that**]
4. Once flat shelf is inserted, the same procedures as Filter Shelf Experiment 1 will be followed.


**Fabrication Method:**
1. We cut a ¾” PVC pipe at a 55-degree angle using a bandsaw, as seen in Figure 3 on the left. The angle was chosen based on last year’s findings -- the filter shelves should be at as steep an angle as possible to minimize sand loss, but the team found it impractical to fabricate cuts at angles steeper than 55 degrees. If we decide to substantially alter their design, we may perform additional tests to measure sand rise at steeper angles.  
2. We then drilled a ¾” hole in a 1” pipe using a hole saw. The 1’’ pipe with the ¾’’ hole is shown on the right in Figure 3.

|**Figure 3:**  On top is the ¾’’ pipe that was cut at a 55 degree angle. On bottom is the 1’’ pipe that had a ¾’’ hole cut from it. The ¾’’ pipe will be welded to the 1’’ pipe.|

[**Same image issue here too**]

3. Our next step will be to weld the pipes together in a similar fashion to last semester’s experiment, and connect the apparatus to pumps so that water will flow in from the bottom, and out through the angled pipe as seen in Figure 3.
