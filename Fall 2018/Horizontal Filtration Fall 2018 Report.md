#### **Abstract**

The goal of Horizontal Filtration is to develop a horizontal filtration system that is more compact and easier to build than AguaClara’s current, Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand Filter model.The Spring 2018 team developed a design that utilized the relationship between backwash and operational speed and angled plate settlers. The main goals this semester are to test the plate settler concept in filtration and backwash conditions, and then fabricate the design. Experimentation was done similar to the one done by the Spring 2018 team except using a slightly different set-up.


#### **Introduction**

The horizontal filtration system stems from the [OrigamiWaterLab](https://github.com/OrigamiWaterLab ) proposed by AguaClara engineer [Ethan Keller](https://github.com/ethan92429). The idea is to fabricate a plant that is able to transition from flat into a 3D plant, much like origami. Currently, the EStaRS filter is unwieldy to ship because of its vertical design. The team of Spring 2018 then proposed a horizontal filtration design that uses horizontal flow for filtration and vertical flow for backwash. This design greatly decreases the amount of space that is occupied by the filter and the various parts that detach and attach cleanly makes transportation of the system far easier. The current design, consisting of an entrance and exit plate with a filter insert in between is shown in Figure 1. The goal this semester is to continue fabrication of the horizontal filtration model, to test the model to ensure that it functions as designed and make any necessary changes to the design.

#### **Previous Work**

During the Spring 2018 semester, the team designed a horizontal filtration system in which the ratio of the horizontal flow area and vertical area is designed such that backwash will fluidize the bed of sand. The fluidization of the sand will cause the sand to act like a fluid allowing the lower density contaminant particles to rise up. The apparatus consists of a series of slits and a filter shelf insert. The slits allowed for water to flow from the inlet to the outlet. Between the inlet and outlet plates is a filter insert that consists of a center plate and filter shelves. The filter shelves served as a place for the sand to settle instead of being carried out with the effluent. The siphon is then able to begin backwash by creating low pressure in the sand bed. Backwash gates are closed except for the bottom slits, requiring a higher velocity of water that rinses away any smaller particles from the sand. A crucial part of the design also lies in the carved channels of the center plate design. These channels allow for the free flow of water along the entrance and exit, as shown in Figure 2 below.

The team will continue tests done in the previous year to determine the feasibility and optimal geometry for the filter slats. The Spring 2018 team performed an experiment to test the functionality of the filter shelves. This experiment determined that the level of sand rise is dependent on the outflow velocity of the water, increasing sharply with increased flow.


Based on what was done by the Spring 2018 team, the Fall 2018 team recreated the experimental apparatus used with the angled pipe to model the filter shelves. Using this apparatus, the experiment was repeated to confirm similar results are able to be achieved. Then, in order to create a model more similar to the actual filter shelves to be used, an experiment involving flat shelf being inserted into the apparatus’ outlet was planned.

#### **Experimentation**

Before fabrication of the filter, the team plans to fabricate multiple apparatuses to test certain components of the filter system. The first is to continue last semester’s experiment of testing the filter shelves.


*Filter Shelf Experiment 1:*
1. A 1” pipe (of a length of approximately 52 cm) was used for the inlet and a ¾ “ pipe (of a length of approximately 32cm) for the outlet. A ¾’’ hole is drilled into 1” pipe about halfway up the pipe. The ¾ “ pipe was cut on one end at an angle of 55 degrees. This was done using the bandsaw and an angle setter set to a 55 degree angle.  More specific details regarding fabrication of the apparatus can be found below in section titled “Fabrication Methods”. The final setup can be seen in Figure 4.  
2. Dry sand was added until  about 4’’ above the opening to the outlet. The amount of sand that enters the outlet was measured.
3. Ends of inlet and outlet pipes were fitted with the appropriately sized couplings and push-to-connect fittings.
4. Inlet and outlet were connected to a peristaltic pump and a flow accumulator to maintain a constant flow rate. Full set up seen in Figure 3.
5. The pumps were set to a speed of 100 RPM (maximum reached by peristaltic pump available). The amount of sand that travels into outlet was measured.

With first attempt of experiment, the team discovered that the inlet fitting was not properly sized and that the apparatus was not water tight, As a result, these issues will have to be corrected before proceeding with the experiment. However, when the pump was turned on, the entire bed of sand was shifted upward in the pipe. Additionally, with the first attempt of setting the flow rate, the peristaltic pump reached its maximum speed of 100 RPM, without actually reaching the flow rate set. As a result, a more powerful pump will also have to be utilized.

**Fabrication Method:**
1. The team cut a ¾” PVC pipe at a 55-degree angle using a bandsaw, as seen in Figure 4 on the top. The angle was chosen based on last year’s findings -- the filter shelves should be at as steep an angle as possible to minimize sand loss, but the team found it impractical to fabricate cuts at angles steeper than 55 degrees. If we decide to substantially alter their design, we may perform additional tests to measure sand rise at steeper angles.
2. The team then drilled a ¾” hole in a 1” pipe using a hole saw. The 1’’ pipe with the ¾’’ hole is shown on the bottom in Figure 4.

|**Figure 4:**  On top is the ¾’’ pipe that was cut at a 55 degree angle. On bottom is the 1’’ pipe that had a ¾’’ hole cut from it. The ¾’’ pipe will be welded to the 1’’ pipe.|

3. The pipes were welded together and filled with sand until sand rose 1.25” above the joint in the angled pipe, and 2” above the joint in the vertical pipe as seen in Figure 5.

4. For the second experiment, flat sheet of PVC will be cut and inserted into the ¾” pipe to mimic the flat geometry of the filter shelves.

|**Figure 5:**  The experimental apparatus had a 1" diameter filter and 3/4" outlet tube. Influent water came in through the bottom and out through the angled outlet and the top.|

**Results**

On the first run of the experiment, as water was pumped into the inlet of the apparatus, the entire bed of sand rose. It was then discovered that the cause of this were the air bubbles forming within the sand as seen in Figure 6. To combat this issue, the apparatus was lightly tapped with a hammer to loosen up the sand and remove the air bubbles. However, when a second attempt of running the experiment was done, the air bubbles returned and presented the same issue as before despite the air bubbles having been successfully removed originally. After the air bubbles were successfully removed by lightly tapping the bed of sand, the sand began to fluidize. At first, the sand rose in the outlet pipe to a height difference ranging from 3-5 cm, which in turn caused the sand height in the inlet to decrease. But it soon stopped rising as the sand settled and the heights remained constant despite the pump still running.

The feasibility of the filter shelf design depends on the sand’s behavior after multiple on/off cycles of the plant. If the total sand rise is the same each time the plant is restarted, then the filter shelf design is likely feasible, provided that the sand does not rise to more than a few inches. However, if the sand rise increases over multiple runs, then the sand will escape from the filter over time and the design is not feasible.

|**Figure 6:** As seen near the bottom of the apparatus, a large air bubble had formed. As the air bubble was pushed upwards, the bed of sand was pushed upwards as well. After air bubbles such as the one seen were removed, the sand was able to successfully fluidize.|


#### **Future Work**

Though the team was unable to begin Filter Shelf Experiment 2, a possible future experiment is detailed below. This experiment would produce a more accurate model of the shape of the actual filter shelves as seen in the design. The flat shelves (modeled by a flat piece of PVC inserted into the outlet) may potentially result in different results as opposed to the curved surface of the pipes being used in Filter Shelf Experiment 1.

*Filter Shelf Experiment 2: Change Geometry*
The apparatus from Filter Shelf Experiment 1 will be used. A flat shelf with the a width of 1’’ is used.
1. The flat shelf is then inserted into the 1’’ pipe horizontally.
2. The flat shelf will be glued or secured in another way at either end to ensure that it does not rotate or move as water is pumped through. Fabrication method elaborated on below.
3. Once flat shelf is inserted, the same procedures as Filter Shelf Experiment 1 will be followed.

One future topic to investigate is alternatives to the angled slats, such as mesh.A mesh alternative would be easier to ensure sand does not travel into the outlet. However, it may result in a slower filtration process.If the slat design is impractical, then alternatives would have to be found that work with the present design and are easy to assemble.
