## **Abstract**

The goal of Horizontal Filtration is to develop a horizontal filtration system that is more compact and easier to build than AguaClaraâ€™s current, Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand Filter model. The Spring 2018 team developed a design that utilized the relationship between backwash and operational speed and angled plate settlers. The main goals this semester are to test the plate settler concept in filtration and backwash conditions, and then fabricate the design. Experimentation was modified from the Fall 2018 team to better emulate the flat shelves of the plate settler concept.

## **Introduction**

The horizontal filtration system stems from the [OrigamiWaterLab](https://github.com/OrigamiWaterLab ) proposed by AguaClara engineer [Ethan Keller](https://github.com/ethan92429). The idea is to fabricate a plant that is able to transition from flat into a 3D plant, much like origami. Currently, the EStaRS filter is unwieldy to ship because of its vertical design. The team of Spring 2018 then proposed a horizontal filtration design that uses horizontal flow for filtration and vertical flow for backwash. This design greatly decreases the amount of space that is occupied by the filter and the various parts that detach and attach cleanly makes transportation of the system far easier. The current design, consisting of an entrance and exit plate with a filter insert in between is shown in Figure 1. The goal this semester is to continue fabrication of the horizontal filtration model, to test the model to ensure that it functions as designed and make any necessary changes to the design.

The top image shows this system complete, while the bottom images shows the filter with the entrance plate removed to better show configuration of the shelves in relation to the rest of the box.|


## **Previous Work**

During the Fall 2018 semester, the team primarily worked on an experimental apparatus based off of the one from the Spring 2018 team. The apparatus, seen in Figure 2, itself consisted of two pipes, one of which was at an angle to represent the angled shelves in the horizontal filtration design. The results of the experiment were mixed. Initially, there was an issue where the entire bed of sand would rise due to air bubbles forming within the sand. Once the sand was loosened, the sand would begin to successfully fluidize and sand rose into the outlet pipe to a height difference ranging from 3-5 cm. However, it was also noted that as the pump was stopped and restarted again, sand rose more into the outlet. Provided that the sand rising after each restart, the design was determined to be feasible; however, it was concluded that it was better to first test with an experimental apparatus more closely resembling the shelf design before making a final conclusion.

## **Experimental Apparatus**

Given that the experimental apparatus design from Fall 2018 involves a curved pipe, the experimental apparatus for this semester's team has been developed to better resemble the actual shelves of the horizontal filtration design. The experimental apparatus essentially consists of a box, with two flat shelves welded onto the side. In between these two shelves and above the top shelf is a slit that allows water to flow out into the pipes attached horizontally to the slits. On the opposite side of the outlet is an inlet hole where water will be pumped in. The CAD drawing of the design is seen below in Figure 3. (still need to finish CAD drawing).

On one end of the box is an inlet hole, the other end has the two flat shelves attached along with slits that are connected to outlet pipes.|


## **Procedure**
After completion of the experimental apparatus, the following procedure will be followed to test the effectiveness of the plate settler concept.

1. Box filled with dry sand, enough to cover both shelves.
2. Inlet connected to peristaltic pump via flexible tubing.
3. Outlet pipes, fitted with appropriately sized couplings, is connected to waste line.
4. Initial sand height measured.
5. Peristaltic pump set to varying flow rates.
6. For each flow rate set, the amount of sand that rises up the shelves is measured and recorded.


## **Fabrication Details**
1. A box (width and length of 20.3cm, height of 17.5cm) was found with a previously inserted push-to-connect connector on one side of the box.
2. From a sheet of PVC, two sheets measuring 10.5 cm x 19.5 cm were cut using the bandsaw.
3. The shelves are welded on at a 55 degree angle, as the original design recommended.
4. A 12 cm x 80 cm rectangular slit will be cut above each shelf for water flow.
5. Approximately 0.5 cm diameter holes drilled in along 16.5 cm of two 2.5 cm diameter pipes.
6. The two pipes are welded onto the side of the box, with the holes facing into the box. These pipes will act as outlets to control the desired flow.
