## **Abstract**

The goal of Horizontal Filtration is to develop a horizontal filtration system that is more compact and easier to build than AguaClaraâ€™s current, Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand Filter model.The Spring 2018 team developed a design that utilized the relationship between backwash and operational speed and angled plate settlers. The main goals this semester are to test the plate settler concept in filtration and backwash conditions, and then fabricate the design. Experimentation was modified from the Fall 2018 team to better emulate the flat shelves of the plate settler concept.

## **Introduction**

The horizontal filtration system stems from the [OrigamiWaterLab](https://github.com/OrigamiWaterLab ) proposed by AguaClara engineer [Ethan Keller](https://github.com/ethan92429). The idea is to fabricate a plant that is able to transition from flat into a 3D plant, much like origami. Currently, the EStaRS filter is unwieldy to ship because of its vertical design. The team of Spring 2018 then proposed a horizontal filtration design that uses horizontal flow for filtration and vertical flow for backwash. This design greatly decreases the amount of space that is occupied by the filter and the various parts that detach and attach cleanly makes transportation of the system far easier. The current design, consisting of an entrance and exit plate with a filter insert in between is shown in Figure 1. The goal this semester is to continue fabrication of the horizontal filtration model, to test the model to ensure that it functions as designed and make any necessary changes to the design.

The top image shows this system complete, while the bottom images shows the filter with the entrance plate removed to better show configuration of the shelves in relation to the rest of the box.|

## **Method**

### **Experimental Apparatus**

Given that the experimental apparatus design from Fall 2018 involves a curved pipe, the experimental apparatus for this semester's team has been developed to better resemble the actual shelves of the horizontal filtration design. The experimental apparatus essentially consists of a box, with two flat shelves welded onto the side. In between these two shelves and above the top shelf is a slit that allows water to flow out into the pipes attached horizontally to the slits. On the opposite side of the outlet is an inlet hole where water will be pumped in. The CAD drawing of the design is seen below in Figure #. (still need to finish CAD drawing).

|**Figure 2:** This image shows the design of the experimental apparatus that better mimics the flat selves of the plate settler concept of the horizontal filtration design. On one end of the box is an inlet hole, the other end has the two flat shelves attached along with slits that are connected to outlet pipes.|


### **Procedure**
After completion of the experimental apparatus, the following procedure will be followed to test the effectiveness of the plate settler concept.

1. step 1
2. step 2
3. step 3


## **Fabrication Details**
1. A box was found with a previously inserted push-to-connect connector on one side of the box.
2. From a sheet of PVC, two sheets measuring ? x ? were cut. These will be used as the shelves.
3. ......
