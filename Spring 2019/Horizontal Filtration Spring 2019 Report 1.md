## **Abstract**

The goal of Horizontal Filtration is to develop a horizontal filtration system that is more compact and easier to build than AguaClaraâ€™s current, Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand Filter model.The Spring 2018 team developed a design that utilized the relationship between backwash and operational speed and angled plate settlers. The main goals this semester are to test the plate settler concept in filtration and backwash conditions, and then fabricate the design. Experimentation was done similar to the one done by the Spring 2018 team except using a slightly different set-up.

## **Introduction**

The horizontal filtration system stems from the [OrigamiWaterLab](https://github.com/OrigamiWaterLab ) proposed by AguaClara engineer [Ethan Keller](https://github.com/ethan92429). The idea is to fabricate a plant that is able to transition from flat into a 3D plant, much like origami. Currently, the EStaRS filter is unwieldy to ship because of its vertical design. The team of Spring 2018 then proposed a horizontal filtration design that uses horizontal flow for filtration and vertical flow for backwash. This design greatly decreases the amount of space that is occupied by the filter and the various parts that detach and attach cleanly makes transportation of the system far easier. The current design, consisting of an entrance and exit plate with a filter insert in between is shown in Figure 1. The goal this semester is to continue fabrication of the horizontal filtration model, to test the model to ensure that it functions as designed and make any necessary changes to the design.
