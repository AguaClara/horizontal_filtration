## **Abstract**

The goal of Horizontal Filtration is to develop a horizontal filtration system that is more compact and easier to build than AguaClara’s current, Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand Filter model. The proposed design consists of a column of sand enclosed by angled shelves to enable water flow. The main goals this semester were to test the plate settler concept in filtration and backwash operations, and then fabricate the design. The team’s objective this semester was to design an experiment that more closely models the filter’s geometry by using a flat-bottomed box and two angled, flat filter shelves.

## **Introduction**

The horizontal filtration system stems from the OrigamiWaterLab proposed by AguaClara engineer Ethan Keller. ·The idea of the OrigamiWaterLab is to fabricate a water treatment plant that is able to be assembled from flat components into a 3D plant, much like origami. Currently, the EStaRS filter is bulky and difficult to assemble **[might be better to say treatment plants in Honduras as it seems like Honduras is the name of the treatment plants when I read this pretending to be someone who knows nothing about AguaClara]** because of its cumbersome vertical design. The Spring 2018 team then proposed a horizontal filtration design that utilized horizontal flow for filtration and vertical flow for backwash. This design, with its easily detachable parts, decreased the volume of space that was occupied by the filter. The easily detachable parts in this design made transportation easier and decreased the column of space occupied. During filtration, water flows horizontally through a column of sand, which is contained on both sides by a stack of angled shelves. During the backwash stage, plates on either side of the filter cover the shelves, only allowing influent flow through a single opening at the bottom and effluent flow through a valve at the top. This design reduces the volume needed, since forward filtration is run horizontally and backwash is run vertically. Since these processes run in different directions, only one inlet and outlet manifold is needed, and is easier to construct than a stacked filter, which has six inlets. The current design, consisting of an entrance and exit plate with a filter insert in between is shown in Figure 1. The left side of the filter is the entrance plate and inlet, where the water flows in; the exit plate is located on the opposite side and is the outlet, where the filtered water flows out. The filter insert consists of the angled shelves, which prevent sand from traveling out with the outlet flow, as shown in Figure 1 below. The goal this semester was to continue fabrication of the horizontal filtration model, to test the model to ensure that it functions as designed and make any necessary changes to the design. **[Use consistent past tense.]**

## **Previous Work**

During the Fall 2018 semester, the team primarily worked on an experimental apparatus based off of the one from the Spring 2018 team. The apparatus itself, seen in Figure 2, consisted of two pipes, one of which was at an angle to represent the angled shelves in the horizontal filtration design. The results of the experiment were mixed. Initially, there was an issue where the entire bed of sand would rise due to air bubbles forming within the sand. Once the sand was loosened, the sand would begin to fluidize and sand rose into the outlet pipe to a height difference ranging from 3-5 cm. Fluidization occurs when the flow of water becomes large enough that the sand particles begin to act like a liquid and obtain fluid properties in terms of movement. As fluidization was not desired for filtration, but only backwash, a successful test would result in no fluidization. **[Explain why fluidized sand bed is defined as a "success" and define fluidize] ****[I see that you half addressed this comment but not quite the first half of it. Please address.]**. However, it was also noted that as the pump was stopped and restarted again, sand rose more into the outlet. The amount of sand that rose up was not a significant amount, only a few centimeters. The insignificant amount of sand rising up proves that if the shelves were used they could sufficiently prevent the sand from rising out into the outlet. **[Why does the sand rising into the outlet mean that the design is feasible?]** **[Address this comment please.]**. However, one possible explanation is that the increased relative surface area of the rounded pipe compared to a flat shelf caused more sand to “stick” to the pipe between trials than would on a flat surface, as in the actual design of the filter shelves. Thus, given the difference between the shape of the experimental apparatus and the actual design of the filter shelves, it was concluded that it was better to first test with an experimental apparatus more closely resembling the shelf design before making a final conclusion.

## **Experimental Apparatus**

Given that the experimental apparatus design from Fall 2018 involved cylindrical piping with a much smaller area than the proposed filter, a more geometrically accurate experimental apparatus for this semester was developed. The apparatus was designed to better resemble the actual shelves of the horizontal filtration design and consisted of flat, wide openings 1-2 cm in height. The experimental apparatus consisted of a box with two flat shelves welded at an angle of 55 degrees onto the side. Above each shelf two rectangular slits were cut, which allowed water to flow out into the pipes welded horizontally to the slits. On the opposite side of the outlet was an inlet hole where water could be pumped in. The CAD drawing of the experimental apparatus's design is seen below in Figure 3. The purpose of this design was to model a geometrically similar filter and observe the sand movement between only two shelves.

**[Same problem as Fig 2]**


## **Fabrication Details**
The box apparatus for this experiment was designed in order to view the movement of sand, if any, between two shelves. The design was increased in scale in an attempt to make fabrication easier. See “Experimental Apparatus” above. The steps and dimensions for fabricating it were as follows:
1. Obtain a polycarbonate box (width and length of 20.3cm, height of 17.5cm), available at the AguaClara lab.  **[This is not necessarily available all the time. It may have been true for you that it was available, but not necessarily in the future. You should probably separate this into two steps. Also, this is very informal writing. Change to formal.]**
2. The box used had a previously inserted push-to-connect connector. The push-to-connect connector was inserted approximately 2 centimeters above the base. **[It says using one sheet, cut two. Could you say cut a sheet into two instead so it's clearer?]**
3. Using a sheet of PVC, obtain two sheets measuring 10.5 cm x 19.5 cm x 0.5 cm using the bandsaw, to fit the width of the box. **[It says using one sheet, cut two. Could you say cut a sheet into two instead so it's clearer?]**
4. Weld the shelves on at a 55 degree angle, as the original design recommended. Weld the first sheet so that both the wall and base are connected and the second sheet approximately 2.5 cm above the first.
5. Cut a 12 cm x 80 cm rectangular slit above each shelf for water flow.
6. Drill holes approximately 0.5 cm in diameter along 16.5 cm of two 2.5 cm diameter pipes. The pipes were 51 cm in length when including caps, although much of it was unnecessary length
7. Weld the two pipes onto the side of the box with the holes facing inward, so that the holes align with the slits. These pipes will act as outlets to control the desired flow.

The completed fabricated apparatus is shown below in Figure 4.

During fabrication of the apparatus, there were issues with the dimensions of the shelves relative to the curved corners of the box. The second shelf was unable to fully reach the wall when it was positioned parallel with the bottom shelf. As a result, a separate piece of PVC, measuring approximately 4.5 cm x 17 cm x 0.5 cm, was welded to the top shelf to connect it to the wall.
Once fabrication was complete, the team verified that the apparatus was watertight. During this process, the team discovered that the apparatus was leaking water. Due to the material of the box and lack of support underneath the shelves, it was difficult to successfully tack the box and shelves in order to firmly PVC weld them together. Instead, hot glue was used in an attempt to cover the leakages. This worked as a temporary solution, but when testing was done, it was evident that there were still small holes in between the PVC and box that were difficult to fix. Ultimately, the curved corners and tapering walls of the box used made fabrication and watertightness difficult to ensure. **[To keep the parts of your report about the failed welded box and the new 3D printing idea, refrain from talking about future plans in this section.]**

## **Procedure**
After completion of the experimental apparatus, the procedure described below, was followed to test the effectiveness of the plate settler concept. The goal of this experimental procedure was to determine at what flow rate the angled shelves will fail to prevent sand from being carried out with the outlet. Additionally, during the experiment the sand in the rest of the box was observed so see if there was any obvious fluidization. Sand traveling up shelves of a filter indicates that the area may be too large and must be adjusted to achieve a lower flow rate.  **[Write in past tense.]**

1. Fill the box with enough sand to cover both shelves.
2. Connect the inlet to a peristaltic pump via flexible tubing.
3. Connect the outlet pipes (fitted with appropriately sized couplings) to the waste line.
4. Measure the initial sand height in between shelves.
5. Set the peristaltic pump to varying flow rates, ranging around 5.5 mL/sec.
6. Measure and record the amount of sand that rises for each flow rate set.

## **Results and Analysis**

For the initial test, several technical problems arose. There were difficulties with finding a 600 rpm pump, as well as calibrating and configuring it to ProCoDa. Once these setbacks were solved, the experiment was able to start. The box was filled approximately two-thirds of the way to the top with sand provided at the lab. Water was added via a beaker until it was almost at the top of the second, upper shelf. The top pipe, was deemed unnecessary because there was no concern of water overflow. The configuration of the tubes was altered so that the water recirculated through the outlet, through the pump, and back accumulator and returned to the inlet. This was done because it was realized that a pump was required for both the inlet and outlet, and only one pump was available. With a flow rate decided on our area and maximum velocity of 5 mm/s, the pump was turned on via ProCoDa and water started to flow. An initial sand height between the shelves was marked on the side of the box. Water was observed to be leaking out of the box via potential holes in between the slits and the pipes. After a few minutes, due to the inlet hole becoming clogged with sand, the inlet was switched to the top pipe, as seen in Figure 5.

<b>Figure 6:</b> A team member added dye to the water at the top of the apparatus in order to track if water was flowing from the top of the sand, though the filter, and into the outlet pipe.
</p>

Red dye was added with a pipette pulse directly outside part of the inlet flow to test if the water was moving correctly. Several leaks were discovered between the two shelves based on the dye’s movement. This was a large problem because this indicated that some of the water was bypassing all of the sand and moving straight to the outlet. If the water was bypassing all the sand, then the water was not being filtered. Due to this fabrication error, data was unable to be collected in relation to height change of the sand.

## **Conclusions**

One of the larger conclusions of the experiment using the fabricated box **[Name the experiment. I know you guys did one, but it's better to not make a habit of assuming the reader knows what you're talking about when you say "this" in different parts of the report.]** was the difficulty of fabricating a water sealed filter with welding and using a box with a geometry of curved corners and tapered walls. In terms of the experiment itself, even with the water leaks, the apparatus worked well by mimicking the water flow of a real filter. It was noted that some sand rose when testing a flow rate above the max failure rate, but it was unclear if this was an accurate occurrence or simply caused by another testing error. This included the leaks or accidental movement of the box when dealing with the clogged inlet or when temporarily adding an additional slab of PVC into the sand.

### **3D Printed Experimental Apparatus**
**[Move this to before the Future Works section.]**
<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AguaClara/horizontal_filtration/master/Spring%202019/images/horfi_3dapparatus_labelled.png"> </p> <p align="center">
<b>Figure 7:</b> The 3D printed model consists of a box (on left), and two detachable shelves (middle), with the fully assembled apparatus seen on the right. It consists of a slit in between the two shelves as well as a slit on the other wall to allow for uniform inlet flow.
</p>

The new 3D printed model was adjusted from the fabricated apparatus, as seen above in Figure 7. 3D printing was pursued as an option for making an experimental apparatus because it would be a much faster process than refabricating a new, entirely water tight, box from scratch. Overall, it was primarily used to save time and allow for easier adjustments in the design as the CAD could easily be edited and reprinted again. The dimensions of the model was based off of the model built by the Spring 2018 team, essentially the shelves were scaled down to a 1:2 ratio. The scaled-down model would theoretically behave in the same way as the original design. It was necessary to scale down the model in order to fit the dimensions of the 3D printers available in RPL. 

In addition, instead of having two slits on the wall with the shelves, only one slit was used. The top slit was determined to be not very necessary to focus on; instead, a slit was added on the wall opposite the shelves to allow for a uniform inlet flow, as was done in the experiment with the fabricated box. These slits would have a pipe, with holes drilled along the length attached, as it was for the original fabricated apparatus. These pipes would be attached to the necessary pumps and allow for controlled circulation of water at various flow rates through the apparatus. Additionally, the shelves were made to be of a more modular style where the shelves can be taken on and off a small shelf on the box of the apparatus. This was done due to a concern of potential drooping of the long shelves when 3D printing, additionally, it would make for easier cleaning of sand in the apparatus after testing. Another major change is that the empty space was narrowed considerably. Originally, the excess empty space was primarily because a premade box was used, however it was assumed that this extra space where only sand would be did not need to be so large.

How to 3D print through Cornell RPL:
1. Draw apparatus using CAD software, such as OnShape.
2. Save the file(s) in the STL format. Name the file with the CAD part name and your Net ID. To export the file from OnShape: right-click on tab of desired file near the bottom of the screen. Choose “Export…”, rename part, and change the format from ParaSolid to STL. Choose the appropriate STL Format, units, resolution, and click “OK” to download.
3. Fill out the Cornell RPL printing form here and attach the STL file.

## **Backwash Testing**

Using the experimental apparatus from the Fall 2018 team, backwash was tested using the following procedure:
1. FIll the straight pipe with sand until nearly full.
2. Plug the angled pipe in order to simulate the closing of the filter outlets during the backwash stage.
3. Due to plant velocity at 11 mm/s, and a pipe diameter of 2.5 cm, the flow rate was calculated to be approximately 5.4 mL/s. Input this into ProCoDa.
4. Run the pump and observe whether or not fluidization takes place. 

Backwash is used to clean out the filter bed in the filtration system. During backwash, the flow rate of the water pumped through flows at a fast enough rate that the sand becomes fluidized. The fluidization of the sand allows the small contaminant particles to float to the top and become siphoned out, as seen in Figure 8.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AguaClara/horizontal_filtration/master/Spring%202018/images/Backwash_steps.JPG"> </p> <p align="center">
<b>Figure 8:</b> In Step 1, water is being filtered in its routine fashion. When the filter becomes saturated with removed particles such as clay, the apparatus experiences an increase in headloss and has difficulty functioning. To solve this, the siphon is activated (Step 2). The filter gates are pulled inward due to this vacuum effect and water can only flow through the bottom. This upflow of water causes the sand bed to fluidize, separating the sand from filtered particles in the process and thus cleaning the filter. These particles leave through a launder pipe (not shown) at the top of the filter box for proper disposal.
  
###**Conclusions**

As mentioned above, with a given plant velocity of 11 mm/s, and a pipe diameter of 2.5 cm, the flow rate was calculated to be approximately 5.4 mL/s. The pump flow rate was set to this, the pump was turned on, and water began to flow into the pipe. Some water flowed partially up the angled pipe, but stopped approximately 13 cm diagonally upward. The sand began to successfully fluidize without traveling up the angled pipe, and instead began to move and circulate through the length of the straight pipe. Additionally, it was noted that no sand moved up and out of the outlet tube. 

This experiment offered encouraging results as to the potential and feasibility of the horizontal filtration design. Because it was observed that the water did not continue to travel up the angled pipe due to the plug, and the sand within the straight pipe successfully fluidized without seeping into the angled one, it indicated that a real horizontal filter’s design provides ideal functions and would not malfunction during backwash. With a successful backwash stage, the filter and it’s sand can be cleansed properly for future use. 

## **Future Work**

Based on the outcome of the experiment, plans were made to 3D print a new apparatus. The box used has curved siding, which made it incredibly difficult to weld the shelves into. This led to leaking and altered any results. With a 3D printed apparatus, the shelves and sides of the box will be connected securely to ensure it is water tight.

## **Appendix**

### **Materials**

- Polycarbonate box (20.3 cm x 20.3 cm x 17.5 cm): container for apparatus
- Two PVC sheets (10.5 cm x 19.5 cm x 0.5 cm): mimic shelves
- Two 2.5 cm diameter pipes (51 cm in length): used as inlet/outlet pipes
- Flex tubing: Used to connect inlet and outlets to peristaltic pump, waste pipe, and accumulator.
- Flow accumulator bottle: Acts as storage reservoir.
- MasterFlex L/S peristaltic pump: Used to pump water into apparatus at set speed.
- Push-to-connect connecters: Used to connect tubing to inlet and outlets.



### **ProCoDa**

The ProCoDa used controlled the turning on and off of the pumps and adjusted the flow rates of the pump.

***States:***

**EXPERIMENT**
The “Experiment” state was used while the experiments were being run. The pump speed was set by the output setting “Ejection Pump”. When running, the pump speed read on ProCoDa was 2.86. The pump itself showed a speed of 287 RPM.

**WAITING**
The “Waiting” state was used while experiments were not being run and the pump was turned off.

***Set Points and Variables Used:***

**"Ejection Pump":** unitless; variable; included set points “Ejection flow rate” and “Ejection Tubing Size”

**“Ejection flow rate”**: mL/s; constant; value of 18.14

**“Ejection Tubing Size”**: unitless; constant; value of 18

### **Python Code**

The code below was used to convert the given approach velocity to the flow rate needed based on the surface area of the sand between the shelves. The approach velocity was chosen to be the velocity at which sand begins to fluidize. Since forward filtration should not have fluidized sand, the maximum velocity needed for the forward filtration experiment would be the approach velocity of 5 mm/s.

```python
from aguaclara.play import*
import math
import numpy as np

import pandas as pd
from aguaclara.core.units import unit_registry as u

Area = 24*215.9*u.millimeter**2  
#the surface area of the sand between the shelves
Approach_velocity = 3* u.millimeter/u.second
#chosen velocity based on a fluidization velocity of 5 mm/s
Flow_rate = Approach_velocity*Area
#Flow rate equation
print(Flow_rate)

```
