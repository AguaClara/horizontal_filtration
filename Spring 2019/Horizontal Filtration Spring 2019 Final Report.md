## **Abstract**

The goal of Horizontal Filtration is to develop a horizontal filtration system that is more compact and easier to build than AguaClara’s current, Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand Filter model. The proposed design consists of a column of sand enclosed by angled shelves to enable water flow. The main goals this semester were to test the plate settler concept in filtration and backwash operations, and then fabricate the design. The team’s objective this semester was to design an experiment that more closely models the filter’s geometry by using a flat-bottomed box and two angled, flat filter shelves.

## **Introduction**

The horizontal filtration system stems from the [OrigamiWaterLab](https://github.com/OrigamiWaterLab) proposed by AguaClara engineer [Ethan Keller](https://github.com/ethan92429). ·The idea behind the OrigamiWaterLab is to fabricate a water treatment plant that is able to be assembled from flat components into a 3D plant, much like origami. Currently, the EStaRS filter is bulky and difficult to assemble because of its cumbersome vertical design. The Spring 2018 team then proposed a horizontal filtration design that utilized horizontal flow for filtration and vertical flow for backwash. This design, with its easily detachable parts, decreased the volume of space that was occupied by the filter. The easily detachable parts in this design made transportation easier and decreased the column of space occupied. During filtration, water flows horizontally through a column of sand, which is contained on both sides by a stack of angled shelves. During the backwash stage, plates on either side of the filter cover the shelves, only allowing influent flow through a single opening at the bottom and effluent flow through a valve at the top. This design reduces the volume needed, since forward filtration is run horizontally and backwash is run vertically. Since these processes run in different directions, only one inlet and outlet manifold is needed, and is easier to construct than a stacked filter, which has six inlets. The current design, consisting of an entrance and exit plate with a filter insert in between is shown in Figure 1. The left side of the filter is the entrance plate and inlet, where the water flows in; the exit plate is located on the opposite side and is the outlet, where the filtered water flows out. The filter insert consists of the angled shelves, which prevent sand from traveling out with the outlet flow, as shown in Figure 1 below.

<b>Figure 1:</b> This image shows the placement of the filter insert within the filter box, specifically between the entrance and exit plates. The top image shows this system complete, while the bottom images shows the filter with the entrance plate removed to better show configuration of the shelves in relation to the rest of the box.</p>

In order to clean the filter after the sand bed becomes saturated with contaminants. Several other components are incorporated into the idealized design to clean the filter as seen in Figure 2. A siphon is used to create a low pressure within the sandbed. And to prevent water from continuing to enter the filter, the backwash gates close off except for a slit on the bottom of the inlet plate. This small slit causes the water to flow up through the sand bed at a higher velocity. The higher velocity causes the sand to become fluidized, allowing the lighter contaminant particles to rise up and be sucked away by the siphon. Once backwash is complete, the siphon is closed and forward filtration continues.

<b>Figure 2:</b>  In this idealized design, the backwash process would go as follows. In Step 1, water is being filtered in its routine fashion. When the filter becomes saturated with removed particles such as clay, the apparatus experiences an increase in head loss and has difficulty functioning. To solve this, the siphon is activated (Step 2). The filter gates are pulled inward due to this vacuum effect and water can only flow through the bottom. This upflow of water causes the sand bed to fluidize, separating the sand from filtered particles in the process and thus cleaning the filter. These particles leave through a launder pipe (not shown) at the top of the filter box for proper disposal (O'Connor, C. et al.).</p>

The goal this semester was to continue fabrication of the horizontal filtration model, to test the model to ensure that it functions as designed, and make any necessary changes to the design.


## **Previous Work**

During the Fall 2018 semester, the team primarily worked on an experimental apparatus based off of the one from the Spring 2018 team. The apparatus itself, as seen in Figure 3, consisted of two pipes, one of which was at an angle to represent the angled shelves in the horizontal filtration design. The results of the experiment were mixed. Initially, there was an issue where the entire bed of sand would rise due to air bubbles forming within the sand. Once the sand was loosened, the sand would begin to fluidize and sand rose into the outlet pipe to a height difference ranging from 3-5 cm. Fluidization occurs when the flow of water becomes large enough that the sand particles begin to act like a liquid and obtain fluid properties in terms of movement. As fluidization was not desired for filtration, but only backwash, a successful test would result in no fluidization. However, it was also noted that as the pump was stopped and restarted again, sand rose more into the outlet. The amount of sand that rose up was not a significant amount, only a few centimeters. The insignificant amount of sand rising up proves that if the shelves were used they could sufficiently prevent the sand from rising out into the outlet. However, one possible explanation is that the increased relative surface area of the rounded pipe compared to a flat shelf caused more sand to “stick” to the pipe between trials than would on a flat surface, as in the actual design of the filter shelves. Thus, given the difference between the shape of the experimental apparatus and the actual design of the filter shelves, it was concluded that it was better to first test with an experimental apparatus more closely resembling the shelf design before making a final conclusion.

## **Experimental Apparatus**

***Fabricated Box Experimental Apparatus***

Given that the experimental apparatus design from Fall 2018 included cylindrical piping with a much smaller area than the proposed filter, a more geometrically accurate experimental apparatus for this semester was developed. The apparatus was designed to better resemble the actual shelves of the horizontal filtration design and consists of flat, wide openings 1-2 cm in height. The experimental apparatus consists of a box with two flat shelves welded at an angle of 55 degrees onto the side. Above each shelf two rectangular slits were cut, which allowed water to flow out into the pipes welded horizontally to the slits. On the opposite side of the outlet was an inlet hole where water could be pumped in. The CAD drawing of the experimental apparatus's design is seen below in Figure 4. The purpose of this design was to model a geometrically similar filter and observe the sand movement between only two shelves.


<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AguaClara/horizontal_filtration/master/Spring%202019/images/fabricated%20apparatus%20drawing.png" height=400> </p> <p align="center">

<b>Figure 4:</b> This image shows the design of the experimental apparatus that better mimics the flat selves of the plate settler concept of the horizontal filtration design. On one end of the box is an inlet hole, the other end has the two flat shelves attached along with slits in between the shelves that are connected to outlet pipes.</p>


***Backwash Experimental Apparatus***

The experimental apparatus used for the backwash testing is the same as the one from the Fall 2018 team’s testing as seen below in Figure 5. This apparatus was chosen because it is easy to simulate the backwash in it. The vertical pipe makes it easy to use a fast flow rate to allow fluidization of the sand in it. And the simple nature of the apparatus also allows for easy viewing of the fluidization and any movement of the sand.

## **Fabrication Details**

***Fabricated Box Experimental Apparatus***

The box apparatus for this experiment was designed in order to view the movement of sand, if any, between two shelves. The design was increased in scale in an attempt to make fabrication easier. See “Experimental Apparatus” above. The steps and dimensions for fabricating it were as follows:

1. Obtain a polycarbonate [box](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Rubbermaid-Commercial-Products-1-5-Gal-Space-Saving-Container-RCP6306CLE/204669670) (width and length of 20.3cm, height of 17.5cm), available at the AguaClara lab.
2. The box used had a previously inserted push-to-connect connector. If not already there, insert the push-to-connect connector was inserted approximately 2 centimeters above the base.
3. Using a sheet of PVC, cut it into two sheets measuring 10.5 cm x 19.5 cm x 0.5 cm using the bandsaw, to fit the width of the box.
4. Weld the shelves on at a 55 degree angle, as the original design recommended. Weld the first sheet so that both the wall and base are connected and the second sheet approximately 2.5 cm above the first.
5. Cut a 12 cm x 80 cm rectangular slit above each shelf for water flow.
6. Drill holes approximately 0.5 cm in diameter along 16.5 cm of two 2.5 cm diameter pipes. The pipes were 51 cm in length when including caps, although much of it was unnecessary length.
7. Weld the two pipes onto the side of the box with the holes facing inward, so that the holes align with the slits. These pipes will act as outlets to control the desired flow.

The completed fabricated apparatus is shown below in Figure 6.
During fabrication of the apparatus, there were issues with the dimensions of the shelves relative to the curved corners of the box. The second shelf was unable to fully reach the wall when it was positioned parallel with the bottom shelf. As a result, a separate piece of PVC, measuring approximately 4.5 cm x 17 cm x 0.5 cm, was welded to the top shelf to connect it to the wall.

Once fabrication was complete, the team flowed water through the apparatus to verify that it was watertight. During this process, the team discovered that the apparatus was leaking water. Due to the material of the box and lack of support underneath the shelves, it was difficult to successfully tack the box and shelves in order to firmly PVC weld them together. Instead, hot glue was used in an attempt to cover the leakages. This worked as a temporary solution, but when testing was done, it was evident that there were still small holes in between the PVC and box that were difficult to fix. Ultimately, the curved corners and tapering walls of the box used made fabrication and watertightness difficult to ensure.

As seen in the back view, two pipes with holes drilled along its length sit against two slits cut in the wall of the box. The top view depicts the extra PVC that was added to allow for the top shelf to connect to the wall of the box.</p>

***Backwash Experimental Apparatus***

The experimental apparatus to test backwash was the same apparatus used from Fall 2018. The angled pipe attached is meant to mimic the angled shelves in the filter design. The apparatus was fabricated in “Fabrication Method” in the [Fall 2018 team’s report](https://github.com/AguaClara/horizontal_filtration/blob/master/Fall%202018/Horizontal%20Filtration%20Fall%202018%20Report.md). The fabrication procedure can also be found under ‘Fabrication Method’ in the Fall 2018 team’s report. The fully fabricated apparatus can be seen above in Figure 5.

## **Procedure**

***Fabricated Box Experimental Apparatus***

After completion of the experimental apparatus, the procedure described below was followed to test the effectiveness of the plate settler concept. The goal of this experimental procedure was to determine at what flow rate the angled shelves will fail to prevent sand from being carried out with the outlet. Additionally, during the experiment the sand in the rest of the box was observed so see if there was any obvious fluidization. Sand traveling up shelves of a filter indicates that the area may be too large and must be adjusted to achieve a lower flow rate.  

1. Fill the box with enough sand to cover both shelves.
2. Connect the inlet to a peristaltic pump via flexible tubing.
3. Connect the outlet pipes (fitted with appropriately sized couplings) to the waste line.
4. Measure the initial sand height in between shelves.
5. Set the peristaltic pump to varying flow rates, ranging around 5.5 mL/sec.
6. Measure and record the amount of sand that rises for each flow rate set.

***Backwash Experimental Apparatus***

Using the experimental apparatus from the Fall 2018 team, backwash was tested using the following procedure:
1. Fill the straight pipe with sand until nearly full.
2. Plug the angled pipe in order to simulate the closing of the filter outlets during the backwash stage.
3. Due to plant velocity at 11 mm/s, and a pipe diameter of 2.5 cm, the flow rate was calculated to be approximately 5.4 mL/s. Input this into ProCoDa.
4. Run the pump and observe whether or not fluidization takes place.

## **Results and Analysis**

***Fabricated Box Experimental Apparatus***

For the initial test, several technical problems arose. There were difficulties with finding a 600 rpm pump, as well as calibrating and configuring it to ProCoDa. Once these setbacks were solved, the experiment was able to start. The box was filled approximately two-thirds of the way to the top with sand provided at the lab. Water was added via a beaker until it was almost at the top of the second, upper shelf. The top pipe, was deemed unnecessary because there was no concern of water overflow. The configuration of the tubes was altered so that the water recirculated through the outlet, through the pump, and back accumulator and returned to the inlet. This was done because it was realized that a pump was required for both the inlet and outlet, and only one pump was available. With a flow rate decided on our area and maximum velocity of 5 mm/s, the pump was turned on via ProCoDa and water started to flow. An initial sand height between the shelves was marked on the side of the box. Water was observed to be leaking out of the box via potential holes in between the slits and the pipes. After a few minutes, due to the inlet hole becoming clogged with sand, the inlet was switched to the top pipe, as seen in Figure 7.

<b>Figure 7:</b> This image shows the new configuration for the apparatus and experiment based on reasons discussed above. The tap water and waste pipes were removed from the design, and instead water recirculates through the experiment by use of the pump (left).

<b>Figure 6:</b> A team member added dye to the water at the top of the apparatus in order to track if water was flowing from the top of the sand, though the filter, and into the outlet pipe.
</p>

Red dye was added, as seen in Figure 8 above, with a pipette pulse directly outside part of the inlet flow to test if the water was moving correctly. Several leaks were discovered between the two shelves based on the dye’s movement. This was a large problem because this indicated that some of the water was bypassing all of the sand and moving straight to the outlet. If the water was bypassing all the sand, then the water was not being filtered.  Due to this fabrication error, data was unable to be collected in relation to height change of the sand.

***Backwash Experimental Apparatus***

For testing, the apparatus was set up as shown below in Figure 9. The peristaltic pump was connected to the vertical pipe as an outlet and an inlet. The angled pipe was plugged in order to better mimic what would occur during the backwash stage. Water was pumped through at the flow rate needed for fluidization of sand. The experimental procedure listed in the section “Procedure” was followed.

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AguaClara/horizontal_filtration/master/Spring%202019/images/backwash_setup.png" height=400> </p> <p align="center">
<b>Figure 9:</b> The experimental setup consisted of the backwash apparatus, a peristaltic pump, and a flow accumulator. The angled pipe was plugged to better mimic what happens during the backwash component of the actual horizontal filtration design. The peristaltic pump was connected to the bottom and top of the vertical pipe to act as the inlet and outlet respectively.
</p>

With a given plant velocity of 11 mm/s, and a pipe diameter of 2.5 cm, the flow rate needed was calculated to be approximately 5.4 mL/s. The pump flow rate was set to this, the pump was turned on, and water began to flow into the pipe. Some water flowed partially up the angled pipe, but stopped approximately 13 cm diagonally upward. The sand began to successfully fluidize without traveling up the angled pipe, and instead began to move and circulate through the length of the straight pipe as seen in Figure 10. Additionally, it was noted that no sand moved up and out of the outlet tube.

<b>Figure 10:</b> The GIF above depicts the fluidization of the sand within the pipe. The sand travelled in a circular pattern, potentially due to a slight deformity in the pipe. However, it can be seen that despite the successful fluidization of the sand, no sand travels up the angled pipe.

### **3D Printed Experimental Apparatus**

***Version 1***

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AguaClara/horizontal_filtration/master/Spring%202019/images/3dprinted_v1_drawing.png"> </p> <p align="center">
<b>Figure 11:</b> The 3D printed model consists of a box and two detachable shelves. The box has slits on opposite walls, intended for the attachment of pipes to allow for even outlet and inlet flow. The shelves have hooks that would rest on the hooks found on the wall of the box. The drawing pdf can be found here
</p>

The [new 3D printed model](https://github.com/AguaClara/horizontal_filtration/blob/master/Spring%202019/HorFi%203d%20Printed%20Design%20Drawing.pdf) was adjusted from the fabricated apparatus, as seen above in Figure 11. 3D printing was pursued as an option for making an experimental apparatus because it would be a much faster process than refabricating a new, entirely watertight, box from scratch. Overall, it was primarily used to save time and allow for easier adjustments in the design as the CAD could easily be edited and reprinted again. The dimensions of the model was based off of the model built by the Spring 2018 team, essentially the shelves were scaled down to a 1:2 ratio. The scaled-down model would theoretically behave in the same way as the original design. It was necessary to scale down the model in order to fit the dimensions of the 3D printers available in RPL.

In addition, instead of having two slits on the wall with the shelves, only one slit was used. The top slit was determined to be not very necessary to focus on; instead, a slit was added on the wall opposite the shelves to allow for a uniform inlet flow, as was done in the experiment with the fabricated box. These slits would have a pipe, with holes drilled along the length attached, as it was for the original fabricated apparatus. These pipes would be attached to the necessary pumps and allow for controlled circulation of water at various flow rates through the apparatus. Additionally, the shelves were made to be of a more modular style where the shelves can be taken on and off a small shelf on the box of the apparatus. This was done due to a concern of potential drooping of the long shelves when 3D printing, additionally, it would make for easier cleaning of sand in the apparatus after testing. Another major change is that the empty space was narrowed considerably. Originally, the excess empty space was primarily because a premade box was used, however it was assumed that this extra space where only sand would be did not need to be so large.

How to 3D print through Cornell RPL:
1. Draw apparatus using CAD software, such as OnShape.
2. Save the file(s) in the STL format. Name the file with the CAD part name and your Net ID. To export the file from OnShape: right-click on tab of desired file near the bottom of the screen. Choose “Export…”, rename part, and change the format from ParaSolid to STL. Choose the appropriate STL Format, units, resolution, and click “OK” to download.
3. Fill out the Cornell RPL printing form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekgNHvlycu1CMCRbkuIaekTqQv8CXMj6_1WWr8VHEtZIcxqw/viewform) and attach the STL file.

***Version 2***

Originally the plan was to print the design above through Cornell’s Rapid Prototyping Lab (RPL). However, RPL was backed up with printing orders and the only printer they had that would fit the design would not be available for another two weeks. So the team decided to see if the printer in the Hollister machine shop would be a possible option. Due to the machine shop’s smaller printer size and inability to fit the design, the team had to cut it in half. The design remains essentially the same except the shelves are no longer detachable as seen in Figure 12. The shelves were made to be no longer detachable because the size of the overall printed material was cut in half, so the drooping of the shelves was determined to be not as big of an issue. Additionally, because the design was cut in half, the new design also has a key-lock attachment joint between the two halves. The [male](https://github.com/AguaClara/horizontal_filtration/blob/master/Spring%202019/3D%20Printed%20V2%20-%20Male%20Half.pdf) and [female](https://github.com/AguaClara/horizontal_filtration/blob/master/Spring%202019/3D%20Printed%20V2%20-%20Female%20Half.pdf) half would fit into place through these attachment joints. The female half has holes that are slightly larger than the keys of the male half to allow for some wiggle room in printing precision.

<b>Figure 12:</b> The new design, designed to fit a smaller 3D printer, remains relatively the same as the original design as shown in Figure 11. The main differences are that the shelves are no longer detachable and that the two halves have a lock and key attachment mechanism to ensure the pieces fit together snuggly. The male half (shown on top) has a convex lock part on where the ‘cut’ was made, while the female half (shown on bottom) has the concave key part where the ‘cut’ was made. These two components would fit together to allow for water tightness of the apparatus. The PDF of the drawing for the male can half can be found here and the female half found here

## **Conclusions**

***Fabricated Box Experimental Apparatus***

One of the larger conclusions of the experiment using the fabricated box was the difficulty of fabricating a water sealed filter with welding and using a box with a geometry of curved corners and tapered walls. In terms of the experiment itself, even with the water leaks, the apparatus worked well by mimicking the water flow of a real filter. It was noted that some sand rose when testing a flow rate above the max failure rate, but it was unclear if this was an accurate occurrence or simply caused by another testing error. This included the leaks or accidental movement of the box when dealing with the clogged inlet or when temporarily adding an additional slab of PVC into the sand.

***Backwash Experimental Apparatus***

This experiment offered encouraging results as to the potential and feasibility of the horizontal filtration design. Because it was observed that the water did not continue to travel up the angled pipe due to the plug, and the sand within the straight pipe successfully fluidized without seeping into the angled one, it indicated that a real horizontal filter’s design provides ideal functions and would not malfunction during backwash. With a successful backwash stage, the filter and it’s sand can be cleansed properly for future use.

## **Future Work**

Based on the outcome of the experiment, plans were made to 3D print a new apparatus. The original box used has curved edges and tapered walls, which made it incredibly difficult to weld the shelves onto. This led to leaking and may have altered any results. With a 3D printed apparatus, the shelves and sides of the box will be connected securely to ensure its watertightness.

In the future, once the apparatus is printed and adjusted if needed, the team would be able to retest using the same procedure as the Fabricated Box Experimental Apparatus. From there, if proved successful, the team could also use the 3D printed box to test backwash. However, a cover with a tube connector would have to be attached to act as a siphon to properly mimic the design’s backwash component. Additionally, if the first 3D printed design is used, the detachable shelves would have to be tested to see if they would stay in place as backwash is run since water is pumped upwards.


## **Appendix**

### **Materials**

- Polycarbonate box (20.3 cm x 20.3 cm x 17.5 cm): container for apparatus
- Two PVC sheets (10.5 cm x 19.5 cm x 0.5 cm): mimic shelves
- Two 2.5 cm diameter pipes (51 cm in length): used as inlet/outlet pipes
- Flex tubing: Used to connect inlet and outlets to peristaltic pump, waste pipe, and accumulator.
- Flow accumulator bottle: Acts as storage reservoir.
- MasterFlex L/S peristaltic pump: Used to pump water into apparatus at set speed.
- Push-to-connect connecters: Used to connect tubing to inlet and outlets.



### **ProCoDa**

The ProCoDa used controlled the turning on and off of the pumps and adjusted the flow rates of the pump.

***States:***

**EXPERIMENT**
The “Experiment” state was used while the experiments were being run. The pump speed was set by the output setting “Ejection Pump”. When running, the pump speed read on ProCoDa was 2.86. The pump itself showed a speed of 287 RPM.

**WAITING**
The “Waiting” state was used while experiments were not being run and the pump was turned off.

***Set Points and Variables Used:***

**"Ejection Pump":** unitless; variable; included set points “Ejection flow rate” and “Ejection Tubing Size”

**“Ejection flow rate”**: mL/s; constant; value of 18.14

**“Ejection Tubing Size”**: unitless; constant; value of 18

### **Python Code**

The code below was used to convert the given approach velocity to the flow rate needed based on the surface area of the sand between the shelves. The approach velocity was chosen to be the velocity at which sand begins to fluidize. Since forward filtration should not have fluidized sand, the maximum velocity needed for the forward filtration experiment would be the approach velocity of 5 mm/s.

```python
from aguaclara.play import*
import math
import numpy as np

import pandas as pd
from aguaclara.core.units import unit_registry as u

Area = 24*215.9*u.millimeter**2  
#the surface area of the sand between the shelves
Approach_velocity = 3* u.millimeter/u.second
#chosen velocity based on a fluidization velocity of 5 mm/s
Flow_rate = Approach_velocity*Area
#Flow rate equation
print(Flow_rate)

```
