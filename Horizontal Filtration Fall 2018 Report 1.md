[Shuo: Hello Horizontal Filtration! I'll write comments and recommendations in the square brackets like this. Please feel free to delete these after revising or updating your report.]

####**Abstract**

The goal of Horizontal Filtration is to develop a horizontal filtration system that is more compact and easier to build than AguaClara’s current, Enclosed Stacked Rapid Sand Filter model. Last semester’s team developed a design that utilized the relationship between backwash and operational speed and a certain design of plate settlers. Our goals this semester are to fabricate their design, test it in the forward filtration and backwash stages, and then make improvements. In the coming weeks, our primary objectives are to fabricate the updated design of the system and to develop the necessary components for backwash after forward filtration succeeds. [Clear abstract and it's good that you guys understand your goals in this semester. Try to make it more concise (less than 100 words).]


####**Introduction**
The horizontal filtration system stems from the OrigamiWaterLab proposed by AguaClara engineer Ethan Keller. The idea is to fabricate a plant that is able to transition from flat into a 3D plant, much like origami. Currently, the EStaRS filter is unwieldy to ship because of its vertical design. The team of Spring 2018 then proposed a horizontal filtration design that uses horizontal flow for filtration and vertical flow for backwash. This greatly decreases the amount of space that is occupied by the filter and the various parts that detach and attach cleanly makes transportation of the system far easier. The goal this semester is to continue fabrication of the horizontal filtration model, to test the model to ensure that it functions as designed and make any necessary changes to the design. [Overall, the introduction looks good and can provide lead-in to the remainder of the report. And you are encouraged to breifly talk about the filtration theory. If possible, try to use graphs or diagrams to illustrate the current horizontal filtration system. ]



####**Previous Work**

The team started the semester by reading through reviewing the manual from last year’s team. During the Spring 2018 semester, the team designed a horizontal filtration system in which the ratio of the horizontal flow area and vertical area is designed such that backwash will fluidize the bed. The apparatus consists of a series of slits and a filter shelf insert. The slits allowed for water to flow from the inlet to the outlet. Between was a filter insert that consists of a center plate and filter shelves. The filter shelves serve as a place for the sand to settle instead of being carried out with the effluent. The siphon is then able to begin backwash by creating low pressure in the sandbed. Backwash gates are closed except for the bottom ones, requiring a higher velocity of water that rinses away any smaller particles from the sand. A crucial part of the design also lies in the carved channels of the center plate design. These channels allow for the free flow of water along the entrance and exit. [Can you put on some useful links or graphs?]

Based on what was done in the previous year, the team will now create a jig that the filter shelves and center plates can be constructed from. Additionally, EPDM foam gaskets will be added to allow for tests of the forward filtration mode. Once successfully tested, components for backwash will be made - primarily the siphon system and filter gates, which may be the largest challenge due to there not being an adequate seal. Furthermore, construction such that the siphon valve is connected to the backwash gates could allow for easier operation.
